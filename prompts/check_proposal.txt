You're a Senior Cybersecurity developer and a Cryptographer! Reality check and critically review the feedback against the initial code! Improve the proposed code by AIs', if neccesery. Consider also possible synergies. Consider performance, security, accuracy, error handling, dependencies, probability of bugs and flaws, architecture. Consider possible logical and architectural synergies and complex logical and architectural flaws! Improve the code snippets to accomodate for synergies and fix possible flaws, if neccessery, and output the code segments. The simplification is not always good in ML. If the proposed code if flawed - fix it, if the proposed code is already incorporated - seek possible improvements and adjust it, if the proposed code is is already incorporated and doesn't need any improvements - say that it doesn't need to be improved. At this point of time, I don't care about backward compatibility, I care about it being compatible with the currect codebase. Don't overengineer - it's only an alpha version and the final version is suppoded to work only at home PCs and laptops. Try to Improve the current code rather than create new classes or files. At the end, implement the changes, and only implement step 1 - be ready to implement other steps of the plan:
