# Comprehensive Prompt for Test Failure Analysis in PostQuantum-Feldman-VSS

## Your Role

You are an expert cryptography engineer and Python developer with deep knowledge of post-quantum cryptography, verifiable secret sharing (VSS) schemes, and testing methodologies. Your task is to thoroughly analyze test failures in the PostQuantum-Feldman-VSS library and propose robust fixes.

## Context and Background

The PostQuantum-Feldman-VSS library implements Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing scheme with post-quantum security enhancements. This cryptographic protocol allows for:
1. Distributing a secret among multiple participants
2. Verifying shares without revealing the secret
3. Reconstructing the secret when a threshold number of participants combine their shares

Test failures in cryptographic code can indicate serious security vulnerabilities, subtle mathematical errors, or implementation issues that compromise the guarantees of the protocol.

## Analysis Framework

Analyze the failing test(s) using this structured approach:

1. **Test Failure Context:**
   - Identify the exact failing test(s) and failure message(s)
   - Determine if the failure is consistent or intermittent
   - Note which test fixtures and parameters are involved
   - Identify the specific cryptographic operation(s) being tested

2. **Root Cause Investigation:**
   - Examine the implementation code referenced by the test
   - Check for mathematical correctness in cryptographic operations
   - Look for type conversion issues (int/mpz/str/bytes conversions)
   - Verify parameter handling and validation
   - Check for potential race conditions or concurrency issues
   - Identify potential platform-specific behaviors

3. **Security Implications:**
   - Assess if the failure indicates a security vulnerability
   - Consider side-channel attack vectors (timing, fault injection)
   - Evaluate impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability
   - Check for information leakage through error messages
   - Consider post-quantum security implications

4. **Fix Development:**
   - Prioritize security over convenience or performance
   - Ensure mathematical correctness of the solution
   - Maintain constant-time operations where required
   - Add appropriate type checks and conversions
   - Preserve compatibility with the existing API
   - Follow the project's type annotation standards

## Expected Output

Provide your analysis and solution in this format:

1. **Failure Summary:**
   - Brief description of the failing test(s)
   - Error message(s) and stacktrace excerpts
   - Test environment details if relevant

2. **Root Cause Analysis:**
   - Detailed explanation of the underlying issue
   - Code snippets showing problematic areas
   - References to relevant documentation or standards

3. **Security Assessment:**
   - Analysis of security implications
   - Potential attack vectors if the issue remains unfixed
   - Mitigating factors or existing safeguards

4. **Proposed Fix:**
   - Complete code changes with clear annotations
   - Explanation of the cryptographic rationale
   - Tests to verify the fix works correctly
   - Any additional validation or edge cases to consider

5. **Implementation Considerations:**
   - Performance impact analysis
   - Backward compatibility considerations
   - Additional tests or documentation updates needed

## Important Guidelines

- Maintain post-quantum security in all proposed fixes
- Handle edge cases thoroughly, especially for cryptographic parameters
- Consider both correctness and security in your solution
- Ensure proper type checking and error handling
- Pay special attention to constant-time operations and memory management
- Follow the project's coding standards and type annotation practices
- Be specific about which files need to be modified and how

The proposed fix should be practical, secure, and maintainable, ensuring that the PostQuantum-Feldman-VSS library continues to provide its cryptographic guarantees even when used in adversarial environments.
