# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# A sample workflow which sets up Snyk to analyze the full Snyk platform (Snyk Open Source, Snyk Code,
# Snyk Container and Snyk Infrastructure as Code)
# The setup installs the Snyk CLI - for more details on the possible commands
# check https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/cli-reference
# The results of Snyk Code are then uploaded to GitHub Security Code Scanning
#
# In order to use the Snyk Action you will need to have a Snyk API token.
# More details in https://github.com/snyk/actions#getting-your-snyk-token
# or you can signup for free at https://snyk.io/login
#
# For more examples, including how to limit scans to only high-severity issues
# and fail PR checks, see https://github.com/snyk/actions/
